I've provided 2 solutions for the assignment 1. 
first I've implemented the racing kings but as talked I've worked on something else which was the delivery.
So I hope that not bothering for you to check both of them.


# About
    this is the very basic implementation for the racing kings game,
    for now it only has one opponent piece to make it super easy.

    you can learn the game from chess.com
